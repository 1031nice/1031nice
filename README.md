### Hi there üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a Backend Engineer who started my career in January 2022. Since then, I've been working in the fintech domain, where I developed a Digital Gifting Service and am currently building a credit loan service using Java and Spring Boot.

My current focus is on understanding and implementing System Design principles and Design Patterns to build highly efficient and maintainable backend solutions. Additionally, I occasionally practice algorithm problems, consistently seeking to sharpen my problem-solving skills.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Languages:** Java
* **Frameworks:** Spring Boot
* **Databases:** MySQL, Redis

### üå± What I'm Learning & Exploring (2025)

* **System Design:** Diving into distributed system architectures, scalability, and resilience.
* **Design Patterns:** Applying advanced patterns for cleaner and more extensible codebases.
* **Algorithm Problem Solving:** Continuously practicing and improving my problem-solving skills on LeetCode.
* **LLM:** Exploring foundational concepts of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on their architecture, fine-tuning, and practical applications in backend services and data processing.
